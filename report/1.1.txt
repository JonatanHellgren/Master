\chapter{Introduction}
In this introduction we will go through some necessary background on artificial intelligence, also some arguments why concern may be raised about its future progress. Then we will take a look at some paths the research is taking in order to avoid the potential issues that could arise with future progress. 

\section{Artificial intelligence}

In recent human history we have seen a massive technological development, our lives today are severally different today compared to a century ago. Most of this development can be seen as the development of tools, that we make use of to carry on with continuing future development. In the beginning of our evolutionary history these tools where thing such as, fire to cook our food or spears and knifes to hunt with. During our history we can see that these tool tend towards more complexity. In recent years a new tool has emerged, namely artificial intelligence (AI), which we will in this report define as, a computer program that is designed to solve a specific set of tasks. Usually these task require a human level of intelligence.

The idea of AI has been around since the dawn age of computer where Alan Turing back in early 1950s being the first to define the concept. There are some reasons to believe that such machines could become very intelligent if designed correctly. Namely the speed of electrical currents in transistors compared to the biological brain is about 1000 times faster, leading them able to 'think' much faster. Also a computer could be turned on for as long as it has a power supply, while a human has a lot of biological requirements that needs to be taken care of to be able to think hard, such as eating and resting. Another reason is that it is much faster and easier to duplicate an AI compared to a human, since one can simply transfer the necessary files and make a copy in minutes, thus a collective intelligence could grow with rapid speed.
%is that it is much easier to increase the size of a computer then a humans brain, one can simply purchase more components and connect them together to get a increase in performance.% Now, the speed and size doesn't mean that the intelligence will increase, but if a human like intelligence where to be applied on a computer we would see extreme results. Say for example if you left a computer on during one night with the task to read, then while you where a sleep it could possibly read more books then you have ever read in your life.

AI have in the recent years been applied in the industry more broadly, this is mostly due to the recent and impressive progress in machine learning, a subfield of AI that aims at constructing algorithms that finds solutions to problems by searching for patterns and correlations in data. This progress have in the recent years become a possibility due to more data being available, faster computer hardware and the massive amount of funding that is spent on research. Although these systems is often quite automated, a key point here is that these systems still require humans to create and function them.


\subsection{Future progress}
% Explain what we are aiming at in the future
When the pioneers in the field of AI started the development, the ideas where not to apply systems that automates a narrow set of task, like we can see in modern AI systems. The ideal was instead to recreate the intellect of a human in a machine, to extend our thoughts from merely thoughts, to a new life form with a base of silicon based hardware instead of carbon based wetware. This is often referred to as artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is an AI that can solve an arbitrary set of tasks with as good or better performance then a human is capable of, the main difference from AI being that the set of task is not bounded. Another similar term is  superintelligence, popularized by Nick Bostroms book the same name, it is a machine intelligence that is smarter then a human in all possible domains.

This shift would would turn our current tool that is AI system to an automated tool, since we have automated the human intervention part away. This would develop an agency in the system, where the system would act as an agent or entity in the world instead of an extension of a human or corporation. Developing intelligent agents is attractive, since the human intervention would likely become a bottleneck.  

% Example of an AGI
Take for example DeepMinds AI system AplhaGo that won against the world champion Lee Sedol in the game of Go, if we where to apply the same system on the task of sorting mail, it would fail spectacularly. The reason is the team of brilliant researchers at DeepMind designed the model specifically to be good at Go\footnote{In more recent years DeepMind have released a new AI called AlphaZero which has a more general approach and is thus able to play Go, Chess and Shogi. Never the less, the set of task is still limited. A finite two-player zero-sum board game.}. An superintelligent machine would on the other hand been able to play a game of Go, then drive its car to its job where it sorts mail and much more. 

There are reasons to believe that such machines are possible to build, namely that we know that human intelligence where able to evolve naturally with evolution. That is as long as we do not believe that intelligence is bound to carbon based life form and thus silicon based ones are unable to develop intelligence.

% consequences of AGI
A significant difference with this shift is that it will increase the possible tasks that a single system can perform, in fact the amount of tasks possible would become arbitrary and they would be performed at human level of performance or higher. The implications of such a breakthrough would likely be on the same scale as the industrial revolution, but instead of automating physical labour we would instead have automated mental labour. Nick Bostrom summarizes this quite well with the following quote, \say{Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity need ever to make}\autocite{Superintelligence Bostrom}. This could be understood by realizing that every possible invention we could come up with and every possible labour, the machine would be able to either invent or to automate by itself.
% superintelligence quote

% AGI is not actually required to see this shift, here are other definitions
Although it has been argued that an AGI breakthrough is not necessary in order to have such a large impact on our world, since a lot of things we humans deem as intelligent will not help the AI in doing so. Take for example speech, if an AI could create convincing and motivating ones, it could have a large effect on things such as politics and thus have a large impact. Another one is finance, where a potential AI could steer the worlds funding towards its specific goals. For this reason many researchers have stopped talking about AGI, and have instead refined the concepts. An AI system that is capable enough to induce transformative consequences on the same scale as the industrial or agricultural revolution is called an \textit{transformative AI} (TAI). On the other hand if this \textit{transformative AI} also would be unstoppable once deployed it is called an \textit{prepotent AI}. 
%Another definition made is the one of a \textit{human-level machine intelligence}, which is achieved when unaided machines can achieve all task better and more cheaply then human workers.
% CRITCH KRUGER, KATJA CRACE SURVEY

%To avoid confusion about all the different types of AI previously described, we will in this report mostly be focusing on transformative AI (TAI). Since it can be argued that it is the first thing that could arise, due to less requirements compared with the other ones. But still being able to cause severe consequences. 

\subsection{Timeline for breakthrough}
% Timeline for when we can see this, first how to estimate it
As for when we will see these breakthroughs in the field that enables the creations of TAI systems, we do not yet know. But with all the focus in the form of funding and research that is applied on it we are undoubtedly getting ever closer. There have been some research on the matter and the results of a survey and a more quantitative forecasting model will in this subsection be presented. % Mayeb John McCarthy quote

% survey result
In the survey presented by \autocite{Grace et al} (2017) they asked researchers in the field of AI to estimate the probability of a human-level machine intelligence (unaided machines that can achieve all task better and more cheaply then human workers) arriving in the future years. The conclusion of the survey where:
\begin{displayquote}
Researchers believe there is a 50\% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years, with Asian respondents expecting these dates much sooner than North Americans.
\end{displayquote}
Although this result should be taken with a grain of salt since they later showed that the respondents of the survey might have been confused about the question, asking the same question with a slight variation gave different answers from the same person. There is still something we can take away from this survey about the timeline, but perhaps it says more about how unsure the research field is. 

In the quantitative forecasting model by \autocite{Ajeya Cotra}, they present a model that predict when TAI will be possible based on a set of estimated parameters. The key idea is to estimate how much computing power the human brain performs and then use the set of parameters to estimate how long it would take for computers to reach this amount of compute. When computers have reached same amount of compute as humans it is assumed that the creation of a TAI system will be possible to create. The set of parameters are things such as, how fast our hardware is developing, improvement in algorithms and how much a potential actor is willing to spend. The results where summarized by \autocite{Robin Shah AN\#121} as the following:
\begin{displayquote}
For the median of 2052, the author guesses that these considerations roughly cancel out, and so rounds the median for development of TAI to 2050. A sensitivity analysis concludes that 2040 is the “most aggressive plausible median”, while the “most conservative plausible median” is 2080.
\end{displayquote}
This forecast presents a shorter timeline compared to the previously presented survey, but it also answers a different question so they cannot be compared directly. Although together they agree on that we will likely see the development of TAI systems this century.  

There are one thing worth mentioning when talking about the timelines for future TAI. It is not necessarily true that the amount of progress will continue to develop with the current rate, it could either decrease or increase. The field of AI has previously been through two winters where the funding and excitement decreased. This was mainly due to high expectations that where not met. So if a third winter where to emerge we could expect the rate of development to decrease. On the other hand, the rate of progress could significantly increase due to a breakthrough in a relevant field, and thus shorten the timeline.

% When the first AGI system has been created we will likely see an intelligence explosion. Since AGI is defined to be able to solve an arbitrary amount of task, this would also include the creation of newer versions of it self. If it is better then the humans that created it at doing so and it keeps doing so recursively, an intelligence explosion would arise, often referred to as the \textit{singularity}.

\subsection{Potential issues}
% explain that there is a existential risk
All tools can be applied in multiple ways, some might be beneficial and some might be ill intentioned. Take for example a hammer, you could either use it to build a house where you can live with your family or you could use it to beat another person to death. The same is the case for AI because it still is but a tool, although the consequences might be more prominent since we do not understand the tool completely, and we thus cannot guarantee that even a well intentioned use of it won't cause any unintended side effects. 

When we design behavior for a AI agent we specify a reward function that rewards the agent when doing the thing we want it to do and discourages unwanted behavior by giving a negative reward. Reward function are very hard to specify, such that it can not be exploited by an agent once employed. When an agent that exploits its reward function is called \textit{reward hacking}, some examples of this include, a robotic vacuum cleaner that was specified to not bump into things hard, started to drive backwards since there where no bumpers on the back\autocite{Custard Smingleigh} and a Tetris playing agent that paused indefinitely instead of loosing \autocite{Dr. Tom Murphy}.

% In the recent years we have seen some examples of how AI can have negative side effects. For example the algorithmic bias we can see in models used by lawyers to determine how long of a sentence a felon would receive after committing a crime, it was shown that the models gave people with darker skin a significantly longer imprisonment\autocite{Karen Hao}. Another one being that social medias exploits our psychology with the help of AI to get our attention and keep us engaged.

These problems are alarming since if we have problem with the AI of today, how is the future going to be when the potential power of them will most likely be greater. Several AI researchers have raised warnings for future development of AI, Stuart Russel and Max Tegmark, Eliezer Yudkowsky to name but a few.

The problem of creating AI that does not cause unintended side effects is often referred to as the alignment problem or AI alignment. Where alignment is referring to that the AIs goals are inline and not conflicting with the goals of a human, corporation or humanity as a whole. When an AI instead does something we didn't intend it to do, it is instead referred to as unaligned.

% The reason for this concern is that with such massive amounts of power they can have, it would be catastrophic if it where to be used in the wrong way. The main concern is unaligned AI. 
%This would of course be a higher risk after a potential AGI breakthrough, since the consequences will most likely be more severe, possibly even be existential. 

In \autocite{Critch Kruger} they present the human fragility argument, which states: 
\begin{displayquote}
  Most potential future states of the Earth are unsurvivable to humanity. Therefore, deploying a prepotent AI system absent any effort to render it safe to humanity is likely to realize a future state which is unsurvivable. %Increasing the amount and quality of coordinated effort to render such a system safe would decrease the risk of unsurvivability. However, absent a rigorous theory of global human safety, it is difficult to ascertain the level of risk presented by any particular system, or how much risk could be eliminated with additional safety efforts.
\end{displayquote}
This argument clearly explains why unaligned TAI or prepotent AI can pose a existential risk to humanity. Here an unstoppable prepotent AI will be of greater risk then a TAI, given that we are able to stop the TAI in time before its effects become to severe.

In the upcoming century Toby Ord, a philosopher that focuses on existential risk, loosely estimates that the probability of humanity facing a existential catastrophe is 17\%, out of which 10 percentage points are due to unaligned artificial intelligence \autocite{precipice}. He arrived at this conclusion by estimating a 50\% chance for an prepotent AI breakthrough and a 20\% chance of failure with alignment of that system \autocite{rationally speaking}. It is however necessary to point our that this is only a estimate that is meant to express the importance of the problem and should not be taken as a fact. The key takeaway here is that there is a quite large chance of facing an existential threat due to future unaligned AI. Also that he believes that unaligned AI poses the highest chance for existential risk in the upcoming century, where other causes where things such as an asteroid impact, nuclear war and pandemics. 
% 50% chance of AGI in next century and 20% of failure with alignment

A common example for how it can go wrong is the paperclip armageddon described in \textit{Superintelligence}. In it there is a gem factory that has an AI which maximizes the amounts of gems being created in the factory. In a update the system is accidentally transitioned to the level of an AGI. Eventually the paperclip maximizer comes to a point where the existence of humans serves no purpose or possibly even having a negative effect on producing paperclips, and thus they become extinct.

\subsection{Basic drives}
One might argue that if an AI described in the previous section where intelligent it wouldn't have acted in the way described, because it would have been stupid and not intelligent at all. But that argument assumes that the system would have common sense, as most of us do, but for an AI it is not sure that common sense will be common. That leads us to the question, what does an AI actually want?

Although we do not yet know what will be the drive for a potential AGI, there have been a lot of work laying the foundations for understanding it. A commonly adopted view (but still controversial) is the Omohundro-Bostrom theory for AI driving forces. There are two corner stones that together implies it, namely \textit{instrumental convergence thesis} and the \textit{orthogonality thesis}, which we will now explain further.

Today the AI systems typically is applied at a task by giving it a goal, this goal could be anything, for example maximizing the amount of paperclips produced by a factory, solving the Riemann hypothesis or counting all the blades of grass on our planet. When the system does the task it is set out to do, it is rewarded.

When the agent pursuits this goal it would naturally arise other instrumental goals, examples of such would be self-preservation, self-improvement, discretization, goal preserverence and resource accumulation. The reasoning behind this is that these instrumental goals helps the agent in its pursuit of its terminal goal. The agent wouldn't be able to perform its goal if it where destroyed for example and thus self-preservation would arise. These instrumental goals will likely be shared between a wide range of different agents, since improving itself and accumulating resources will likely help the agent regardless of its terminal goal. Thus there is a set of instrumental goals which agents would naturally converge towards and hence the name.There are some examples where the terminal goal does not induce a power seeking tendencies, for example if the goal is to kill itself, or to not do anything. 

To this day there doesn't yet exist any rigorous mathematical proof for this. Some work has however been done in trying to lay the necessary foundations for it. \autocite{TURNER et al}. In the paper they prove in a simplified environment that there are certain actions that gives the agent more power over the its future actions and on average it is optimal to choose those actions. 

The orthogonality thesis was first described by Nick Bostrom in his book \textit{superintelligence} \cite{Bostrom}, it states that the intelligence of an AI has no correlation with what goal it might have. Thus an very intelligent AI could in theory have from our point of view a stupid task, such as counting the all the blades of grass on our planet. Or it can have a goal that we may deem as a important one, like keeping the climate on earth habitable for the species that currently live on it. For an AI both of this tasks would be as important, given that we assigned the goal to it during its creation. The same would be the case for a not so intelligent AI.

If we accept the Omohundro-Bostrom theory and thus assume that the \textit{instrumental convergence} and the \textit{orthogonality thesis} is true, we can explain why a goal such as gem maximization can have existential consequences.
