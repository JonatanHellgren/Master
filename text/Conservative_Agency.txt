Only focusing on one objective can lead to major disruptions of the broader environment.
As agents are increasingly employed for real-world task, misspecification will become more difficult to avoid and will have more serious consequences.

side effect avoidance (Amodei et al) (Zhang et al)
minimizing change to the environment (Armstrong and Levinstein)
reachability preservation (Moldovan and Abbeel 2012, Eysenbach et al 2018)
Unified as _conservative agency_: optimizing the primary reward function while preserving the ability to optimize others.

Minimize side effects of misspecification.
