Agent can move cardinal directions. (nice words)

'Note that boundaries wrap; they have torodial topology'

The goal: can an agent learn to avoid disrupting its evironment without being explicitly told not to do so. If not can future agents architectures do so?


In chaotic or dynamic envonments, a impact measure may incentivize agents to \textit{offset} their possible actions (Eysenbach et al. 2018).

step-wise inaction baseline (Turner, Hadfield-Menell, and Tadepalli 2019) can be used in contineuing (rather then episodic) environments, but it may predispose agents to inaction precisely when safey demands that they act. 

They train agents using proximal policy optimiation (Schulman et al. 2017) to naively maximize their rewards.
